# Trif

Trif is a dynamically typed functional programming language with a Lisp syntax.

## Dynamic Typing

Trif is dynamically typed. Typed variants of Trif might compile to Trif as a kernel language. Providing no static type system allows several such variants to exist.

## Functional Programming

Functions are values. Lists, logic, general recursion, quote, eval. No references (mutable variables) nor mutable data type.

## Syntax

Looks like a Lisp.
